To Do
10.10.2025

FRIDAY ... what.  To. Do.

Order my "mixtape" book.  (I'd better just do it.)

Get my signature back up. (I'd better just do it.)

Figure out the difference between mine and her's data



But it's Friday, and I'm in . .  .

It's actually my HR day.  I think I'll dive into that.
- Review where I was
- Write my flow charts of the different regimes
- Show off the Shiny apps
- Meet with Dave Howell
- Conduct the one-by-one brute force

OK, let's do --- PI TURNOVER!

First question --- uhhhhh, where's my Shiny apps?  Didn't I have those in a separate folder?
